# ventoy-electric-penguin
Inspired by a meme I saw on [r/linuxmemes](https://reddit.com/r/linuxmemes) (sorry, I can't find the original post)

This is based on this theme, I just changed the background with a crappy image I made on GIMP: https://www.gnome-look.org/p/2055783

To install, just clone the repo and move the directory `ventoy` into the place you keep your ISOs
